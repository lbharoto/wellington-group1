# Clustering, Forecasting, and Distance-Based Approaches to Anomaly Detection in Financial Time Series

This research project collaboration between the IEOR department and Wellington Management Group. This repo summarizes a continuation of two prior semesters of work dedicated to detecting anomalies in financial time series data. The prior groups utilized the LSTM Autoencoder model for anomaly detection, with one of the groups training the model on the entire time series dataset, marking the top k-highest reconstruction errors as anomalies. The subsequent group introduced three distinct methods: a modified LSTM model, the Bayesian Hierarchical Model, and Wavelet Analysis. In this project, we introduced a range of methodologies encompassing clustering, forecasting, and distance-based approaches. These three techniques were realized through a Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbor, Isolation Forest, Spectral-Residual Analysis, SARIMA model, Prophet, and an original model we developed from the ground up. Our primary aim was to assess their efficacy and ascertain the optimal approach for conducting anomaly detection. Our findings found that each method possesses inherent strengths and weaknesses, attributed to the distinct paradigmatic foundations within each technique. Through a comprehensive comparison of outcomes, we hope to offer valuable insights to both practitioners and researchers, aiding them in selecting the most suitable technique for specific use cases. Furthermore, we extend suggestions for future research directions that can elevate the field of anomaly detection within time series data.
